## ☕ More about 
I've developed an application that acts like an online newspaper, in which the user is able to filter by news categories and view more information on the desired news item. Each news item has a description, date published, self, image and link to the site.

 It is also possible to search for a particular news item, thus further detailing the search for information in the application.

<br>
Besides that, obviously the project is 100% adaptable for mobile devices and strategy planned for future software maintenance.
